# Exercise 2 - Word Cloud

The file [cloud.html](./cloud.html) contains a paragraph of text.

In this paragraph, find the 12 most often occuring words, and put them in a word cloud below the paragraph.

If you do not know what a word cloud is, here is an example for you: [cloudExample.jpg](./cloudExample.jpg).

The most often occuring word should have a font size of 64px. The second most often occuring word should have a font size 60px. The third most often occuring word should have a font size 56px. And so on, down to the 12th most often occuring word with a font size of 20px.

Other stylings are completely up to you! Colors, arrangement, how the words are flipped - that's your decision.

You may edit [cloud.html](./cloud.html), [cloud.js](./cloud.js), and [cloud.css](./cloud.css).
